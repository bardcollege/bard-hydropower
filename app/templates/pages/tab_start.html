        <h3>The Microhydropower Calculator helps estimate the power generation potential of a micro-hydroelectric turbine installation.</h3>
		<p style="color:black;font-weight:bolder">This calculator relies on publicly-available, map-based data to generate estimates of electrical power
            potential. Default values are provided, but users may manually override the default and map generated values.
            It's important to understand that not 100% of the available water may pass through the generator, and that
            generators are not 100% efficient.
            <br/><br/>
            This calculator is not a precise tool and is not intended to replace field measurements or surveys. Dam owners should
            discuss their options with a micro hydropower design professional as individual circumstances may vary.
            <br/><br/>
            While Bard College has endeavored to ensure that the supplied calculations and information are based on valid
            assumptions and approaches, outputs from the calculator are meant to guide only. Users should verify the information
            obtained through the calculator independently. Bard College takes no responsibility for any error or defect therein.
            Bard College shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from the use or reliance of any data supplied by the
            calculator.

        <p>This calculator will guide you through these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Site Identification.</strong> Use the map and available data layers to identify a spot suitable for a potential
                microhydropower installation. Diagram the location on the map, and the calculator will automatically estimate
                head (elevation change) and delineate the contributing area using available topographic data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Parameters.</strong> Input calculation coefficients and other assumptions used in the calculation (sensible
                defaults are provided). Optionally, override the head and area estimates derived from data in Step 1.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Results.</strong> View the analysis results, including total kilowatt hours and estimated revenue generation.</li>
